    abstract = {From 2010 to 2012, 246 data storage tags were deployed on European seabass in the Iroise Natural Marine Park, a marine protected area (MPA) off west Brittany, France. A return rate of 14.6\% associated with long time series of data provided new information on fish ecology (e.g. maximum experienced depth greater than 225 m, temperature range 6.80–21.87°C). Depth and temperature series were used to infer individual migration using an innovative hidden Markov model (HMM) especially developed for seabass geolocation. Reconstructed fish tracks revealed that seabass is a partially migratory species, as individuals exhibited either long-distance migrations towards the Bay of Biscay or the Celtic Sea, or residency behaviour in the Iroise Sea. Fidelity to summer feeding areas and to winter spawing areas was demonstrated. These results suggest that the population is spatially structured. The Iroise Sea is likely a mixing zone for different stocks or sub-populations, and may also shelter a resident population. At the population scale, such findings may impact ICES stock assessment and the resulting decisions from EU managers. At the local scale, conservation action could be taken by MPA managers. Besides, this study demonstrates the high potential of archival tags for investigating multi-year behavioural patterns such as site fidelity to offshore spawning areas.},

    abstract = "{Large-scale electronic tagging is a very powerful tool to study how fish movements and migrations shape the internal dynamics of populations. This knowledge, crucial for improving fishery management, was still limited for the European seabass, whose stocks in the Northeast Atlantic have declined drastically over the last decade. To better understand the species ecology and the spatio-temporal structure of the population, we tagged seabass in the North Sea, the English Channel, and the Bay of Biscay, from 2014 to 2016. Out of 1220 deployed DSTs, 482 have been recovered by November 2022. Approximately half of them included a period of potential spawning migration. Reconstructed trajectories confirmed seabass to be a partial migratory species, as individuals exhibited either long-distance migrations or residence. Most migrants exhibited fidelity to summer feeding areas and winter spawning areas. Our dataset enriches the knowledge of seabass biological traits (e.g. temperature and depth ranges, vulnerability to predation and fishing). Our results suggest a spatial structure of the Atlantic population that differs from the stock structure currently considered for assessment and management. The consequences should be explored at both the European level and by regional managers involved in conservation outcomes.}",

    abstract = {Abstract Uncertainties in fish tracking studies limit their integration into conservation and fisheries management plans. This is especially true for archival tagging studies that rely on geolocation models to infer fish tracks from recorded environmental variables. Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) are increasingly popular to geolocate marine fish equipped with archival tags; however, true errors and sensitivity of geolocation HMMs are seldom evaluated. In this study, we first review validation methods and implementations of geolocation HMMs to adapt to regional oceanography, fish species and tag data. We then use a case-study to evaluate strengths and limitations of each validation approach and to illustrate the sensitivity of geolocation HMMs to implementation assumptions. Simulated and fixed tag locations are the most widely implemented methods, but less common methods relying on true fish tracking, that is double-tagging or distance from recapture experiments, provide more informative estimates of model accuracy and precision. Results showed that model performance can be improved using simple assumptions when pre-processing tag data rather than using a complex movement behaviour model. In addition, accelerometer show potential to further parameterise geolocation models. Overall, results from our case-study and previous studies showed that current geolocation HMMs have average errors of ca. 30–50 and 120 km for demersal and large pelagic fish, respectively. We suggest that these errors are acceptable for investigations at the scale of fisheries management units.},

    abstract = {Numerous methods have been developed to geolocate fish from data storage tags. Whereas demersal species have been tracked using tide-driven geolocation models, pelagic species which undertake extensive migrations have been mainly tracked using light-based models. Here, we present a new HMM-based model that infers pelagic fish positions from the sole use of high-resolution temperature and depth histories. A key contribution of our framework lies in model parameter inference (diffusion coefficient and noise parameters with respect to the reference geophysical fields—satellite SST and temperatures derived from the MARS3D hydrodynamic model), which improves model robustness. As a case study, we consider long time series of data storage tags (DSTs) deployed on European sea bass for which individual migration tracks are reconstructed for the first time. We performed a sensitivity analysis on synthetic and real data in order to assess the robustness of the reconstructed tracks with respect to model parameters, chosen reference geophysical fields and the knowledge of fish recapture position. Model assumptions and future directions are discussed. Finally, our model opens new avenues for the reconstruction and analysis of migratory patterns of many other pelagic species in relatively contrasted geophysical environments.}

abstract = "Combining fish tracking methods is a promising way of leveraging the strengths of each approach while mitigating their individual weaknesses. Acoustic telemetry provides presence information as the fish move within receiver range, eliminating the need for tag recovery. Archival tags, on the other hand, record environmental variables on tag retrieval, enabling continuous path reconstruction of a fish beyond coastal regions. This study capitalizes on the combination of both methods for geolocating pollack, Pollachius pollachius, an understudied species of the northeast Atlantic, where declining stocks are raising concern. Essential knowledge of population structure and connectivity between essential habitats is critically lacking and could help inform stock assessment and management. The aims of the study were (1) to evaluate the feasibility of double‐tagging pollack, known for being challenging to tag, and (2) to track seasonal movements across the Channel to gain first insights into pollack spatial ecology. In 2022, an extensive network of acoustic receivers was been deployed in the Channel along the French, English, and Belgian coasts as part of the Fish Intel project. We tagged 83 pollack with acoustic transmitters, among which 48 were double‐tagged with data storage tags. Post‐tagging survival assessment, conducted on a subset of 35 individuals, revealed a successful procedure with a 97% short‐term survival rate. By October 2023, the acoustic telemetry network detected 30 out of 83 pollack at least once, with no large‐scale movements observed across the Channel. Presence in the network fluctuates seasonally, peaking in summer, particularly among immature fish. Integrating acoustic detections with temperature and depth time series in a geolocation model enabled trajectory reconstruction of 10 recaptured pollack, seven of which were detected by the network. This combined tracking approach revealed coastal movements along the coast of Brittany in France, highlighting the ecological significance of the Iroise Sea for pollack throughout the year, particularly in summer. The geolocation model also suggested movements towards the entrance of the western Channel. This study highlights the complementarity of acoustic telemetry and archival tagging in reconstructing fish movements in their natural environment. As data accumulate, these innovative tracking methods promise to continually unveil new insights into the spatial ecology of the understudied pollack, which is essential for the species' management."

abstract = {Abstract Technological advances are key to maximizing the information potential in electronic tagging studies. Acoustic tags inform on the location of tagged animals when they are in the range of an acoustic receiver, whereas archival tags render continuous time series of logged sensor measurements, from which trajectories can be inferred. We applied a newly developed acoustic data storage tag (ADST) on 154 animals of three fish species to investigate the potential of this combination tag. Fish trajectories were reconstructed from logged depth and temperature histories using an existing geolocation modelling approach, adapted to include a likelihood for acoustic detections. Out of 126 detected fish (accounting for over 700,000 detections) and 25 tag recoveries, eight ADSTs rendered both acoustic and archival data. These combined data could validate that the original geolocation model performed adequately in locating the fish trajectories in space. The acoustic data improved the timing of the daily position estimates. Acoustic and archival tagging technologies provided highly complementary information on fish movement patterns and could partly overcome the limitations of either technique. Furthermore, the ongoing developments to acoustically transmit summary statistics of logged data would further increase the information potential of combination tags when tracking aquatic species.},
