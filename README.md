# Pangeo-Fish 🐟

**Pangeo-Fish** is an open, community-driven project designed to leverage the power of the Pangeo ecosystem specifically for fish biologging data analysis and related oceanographic research. The project facilitates scalable, reproducible, and collaborative research by integrating biologging data with environmental datasets using cloud-native technologies.

## 🌊 Project Goals

- **Simplify Biologging Data Analysis:** Integrate and streamline analyses of diverse fish biologging datasets with oceanographic and environmental data.
- **Leverage Cloud Infrastructure:** Utilize Pangeo technologies such as Xarray, Dask, and Jupyter to perform large-scale, efficient computations.
- **Promote Collaboration:** Foster an inclusive community where researchers and developers can share expertise, resources, and innovative tools.

## 🚀 Quick Start

Install directly from PyPI:

```bash
pip install pangeo-fish
```
